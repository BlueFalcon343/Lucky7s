# Lucky7s
Team project with 6 team members working on a 3D hallway with guard Escape Game.
During this project, we created a 3D escape game in Unity using assets, programming, and design made by solely our team members.
Contributions:
Noah Ferguson(Producer/Programmer): Created the enemy AI that allowed the enemy to patrol randomly, search for the player, and attack the player. Applied art assets to create working menus throughout the game. Worked with lighting for the lanterns in the game. Distributed and managed tasks for the entire team through ClickUp.
Peter Ochoa(Programmer): Created player movement and camera. Integrated the game with controllers. Designed the HUD and UI.
